==========

This is a Garage Controller that will be able to open/close the garage door, tell me when to stop pulling forward, and read garage door open/close status.  The controller will run on a Spark Core and will use a supersonic range finder to get the distance from the wall to the car bumper to tell me when to stop pulling forward, it will use a reed switch to tell if the garage door is open or not, and it will be able to interface with the garage door opener without changing any of the existing hardware.
